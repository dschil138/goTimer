# goTimer
### A go/chess clock timer with byo yomi functions
 
 This is a very old project, one of the first things I ever wrote in C++. The code is not pretty! But as far as I can tell, it is the only open source code available for a Go Timer that has Byo-Yomi overtime periods. So I keep it up in case anyone wants to use it. The code might not be efficient, but it works and has no problem at all running on an Arduino Nano!
